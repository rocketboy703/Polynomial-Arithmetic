Program Design

The program calculates the sum and product of up to 11 polynomials in one variable “x”. The polynomials must be entered in simplest form. Negative exponents and coefficients are allowed.

Procedural/Functional Decomposition
•	Problem is broken down into subtasks handled by different functions
•	Data and data structures passed around via parameters
•	No objects are included in the program

No library functions are included in the program.

Key Data Structures
•	Linked lists (Defined as type Polynomial) to organize and store each individual polynomial, where every node is a term
•	Arrays to group polynomials into sets, arrays of data type Polynomial are initialized
•	String variables for input validation, all user inputs are initially stored in a string and then manipulated to check for correct format and characters

Algorithm Design
•	Required Tasks
o	Storage of organized lists of numbers, letters, and operation signs that vary in length
o	Addition of lists (2 polynomials at a time) 
o	Multiplication of lists (2 polynomials at a time)
•	Solution
o	Store the characters of the polynomial in linked lists to accommodate for varying list sizes
o	Add polynomials by combining like terms in ascending order and storing the sum in a new linked list
o	Multiply polynomials by finding the product of each term in the two lists, handling varying sizes by adding the any remaining terms to the product which is stored in a new linked list

Time complexity of operations
•	Add Function: O(n)
•	Multiply Function: O(n^2)

Space complexity of operations
•	Add Function: O(n)
•	Multiply Function: O(n)
